Sarah/Oryx has been hacking most of her life. She started by taking apart avionics, then making detonators to set off modified firecrackers. She realised she liked her fingers and didn't feel like jail would suit her, orange is not good on her, so she quickly moved on. Many disassembled computers/electronics were housed by her mother over the years, before she was forced to throw them out. Her father taught her to fix things, her mother taught her to question everything. It was the best upbringing for her current "job". She thinks she has the best job in the world.

Although she had a slight detour designing and building
systems before returning to hacking/security. When asked why it took her so "long" to return, she shrugs "we all make foolish mistakes when we are younger". She is happy to be back
scratching her itch in security. When she is not hacking, she is practicing her lock picking
and training in Muay Thai. She splits her time between a small town in Northern Saskatchewan (and you thought she would tell you where?), Amsterdam and Vancouver.
