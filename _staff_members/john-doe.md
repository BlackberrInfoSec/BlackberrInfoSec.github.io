Sarah has been hacking most of her life. She had a slight detour designing and building
systems before returning to hacking/security. When asked why it took her so "long" to return, she shrugs "we all make foolish mistakes when we are younger". She is happy to be back
scratching her itch in security. When she is not hacking, she is practicing her lock picking
and training in Muay Thai. She splits her time between a small town in Northern Saskatchewan, Amsterdam and Vancouver.
